=======================

**Introduction** 🤔
---------------

AegisAI is a fact-checking AI project that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate the accuracy of user-provided text. This project is designed to be a solo indie dev-friendly, easy-to-use, and deployable solution for fact-checking news articles.

**Installation** 💻
--------------

To get started with AegisAI, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

* Python 3.8+
* `langchain-core` library (`pip install langchain-core`)
* `langchain-google-genai` library (`pip install langchain-google-genai`)
* `dotenv` library (`pip install python-dotenv`)

**Setup Environment Variables** 🌎
---------------------------------

Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:

* `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google API key (required for Google GenAI integration)
* `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key (optional, but recommended for improved performance)

**Usage** 📚
---------

To use AegisAI, simply run the `app_backup.py` script and pass a news URL as an argument:

```bash
python app_backup.py https://example.com/news-article
```

Replace `https://example.com/news-article` with the actual URL of the news article you want to fact-check. The script will print the result of the fact-checking to the console.

**Commands** 📚
-------------

The following commands are available:

* `python app_backup.py <news_url>`: Run the fact-checking script with a news URL
* `python app_backup.py --help`: Display help message and usage instructions

**Deployment** 🚀
--------------

To deploy AegisAI, you can use a cloud platform like Google Cloud or AWS. Here are the general steps:

1. Create a new cloud project and enable the Google GenAI API (if using Google Cloud)
2. Create a new virtual environment and install the required dependencies
3. Upload your `.env` file to the cloud platform
4. Deploy your `app_backup.py` script to the cloud platform
5. Configure the cloud platform to run the script with the desired news URL

**Example Use Cases** 📊
----------------------

* Fact-checking news articles for accuracy
* Evaluating the credibility of online sources
* Identifying biased or misleading information

**Troubleshooting** 🚨
-------------------

* If you encounter issues with the Google GenAI API, check your API key and ensure that the API is enabled in your cloud project
* If you encounter issues with the `langchain-core` or `langchain-google-genai` libraries, check the library documentation and ensure that you have the latest versions installed
